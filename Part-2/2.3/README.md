# Part 2

## 2.3

To run the frontend and backend applications together it is enough to run

```cmd
docker-compose up
```

After getting the applications up and running you can navigate to http://localhost:5000 to see whther the connection between the two applications actually works. To do this, press the button *Press to Test!*.

It is to be noted that the two applications in this folder are exact replicas of the applications below

* https://github.com/LoserPanda/frontend-example-docker/tree/feature/connect-to-backend 
* https://github.com/LoserPanda/backend-example-docker/tree/feature/connect-to-frontend

These have been forked, in return, from other applications.
